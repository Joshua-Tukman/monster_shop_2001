  # my street address
  # my city
  # my state
  # my zip code
  # my email address
  # my preferred password
  # a confirmation field for my password
  # When I fill in this form completely,
  # And with a unique email address not already in the system
  # My details are saved in the database
  # Then I am logged in as a registered user
  # I am taken to my profile page ("/profile")
  # I see a flash message indicating that I am now registered and logged in
